Making and developing R packages for RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines)

# 1. Introduction

This training is based on Matthew Gregory's free online course 'Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using R' (see https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) and Hadley Wickham's book 'R Packages' (see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)

The goal of this training is to teach you how to develop packages with a particular emphasis on RAP. Thankfully they are not difficult to make.

Hadley Wickham's introduction (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) states: "Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data."  The minimal contents of a package include: functions, tests, documentation and data (which can be made up where real data are sensitive). Within an R package (e.g. https://github.com/DCMSstats/eesectors): 

- R code is in the directory 'R'; 
- data in 'data'; 
- documentation in 'man'; 
- QA in 'tests'; 
- dependency management in 'packrat'; and 
- templates on how to use the package in 'vignettes'.

There are benefits to each statistical production using RAP being within a package.   

# 2. Choose a name

Possibly the hardest part of creating a package is choosing a name for it. This should be both short and unique (for google searches) and include either upper or lower case characters but not a mixture of them. If the package is to do some RAP work, we may want to consider putting 'rap' at end of the name. 

You can read more about naming a package in the 'Naming your package' section of  http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html 

In this training we're going to create a package to RAP the short statistical bulletin that we create as part of the Rmarkdown training - see https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rmarkdown_training  As such you could choose a name such as egnamerap where the eg is because it's a training exercise, the name is your first name (if not the same as someone else's) and the rap because you are going to RAP a short statistical bulletin.

Exercise 1: Decide what name to call your package
