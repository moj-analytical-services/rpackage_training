```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
crimedata <-read.csv('crimedata2.csv')  
```

# Trends over time
Over time, the number of crimes has changed.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
ggplot(crimedata , aes(year, crimes)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')

```

# Key figures
```{r echo=FALSE}
maxcrimes <- max(crimedata$crimes)
mincrimes <- min(crimedata$crimes)
```
The minimum number of crimes was `r mincrimes` and the maximum was `r maxcrimes`

```{r echo=FALSE}
crimedata <- arrange(crimedata, year)
latestyear <- last(crimedata$year)
latestcrimes <- last(crimedata$crimes)

```
In the latest year `r latestyear` there were `r latestcrimes` crimes.
