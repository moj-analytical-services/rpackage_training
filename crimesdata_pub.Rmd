```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
crimedata <-read_csv("/home/aidanmews/crimedata.csv")  
# data(crimedata)
devtools::load_all() 
```

# Trends over time
Over time, the number of crimes has changed.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
ggplot(crimedata , aes(year, crimes)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
```

# Key figures
```{r echo=FALSE}
maxcrimes <- max(crimedata$crimes)
mincrimes <- min(crimedata$crimes)

crimes_raw_data <- dplyr::arrange(crimes_raw_data, year)
earliestyear <- dplyr::first(crimes_raw_data$year)
latestyear <- dplyr::last(crimes_raw_data$year)
latestcrimes <- dplyr::last(crimes_raw_data$crimes)

crimes_decade_previous <- filter_crimes(crimes_raw_data, paste((latestyear-10):(latestyear-1)))
```
Since `r earliestyear`, the minimum number of crimes was `r mincrimes` and the maximum was `r maxcrimes`. 

In the latest year `r latestyear` there were `r latestcrimes` crimes. This compares to an average of `r round(crimes_decade_previous,0)` over the previous decade (from `r latestyear-10` to `r latestyear-1`).
